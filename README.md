# fractol

fractal explorer with minilib X (very small X library)

3 types of fractal implemented :

- mandelbrot
- julia
- burningship

### features

I used the long double type with quadruple precision format on 128bits -> The zoom into mandelbrot is awesome before saturation

### option 

- the thread option available with choice of number of thread by CLI
- size win choice before start of software
- ...
